Client: Louise


## Overview of Project
Our client Louise has a lot of experience in organizing crowdfunding. Our company was able to carefully display the potentials and treads based on her past crowdfunding data. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find the outcome on given criteria:
Based on launch date

Based on pledged amount
Successful and canceled shows 

## Analysis and Challenges 
The client is submitted with different charts and tables using Excel. We extracted and created different sheets based on the single datasheet that was provided to us. We have designed the project to make it easier for our client to filter her findings and plan for future crowdfunding. 
The data was not sorted properly, hence our company was able to clean the data and change the dates and make it more readable. The client is provided with different statistics and charts for the convenience of Louise, our client. Given is the graph to show how crowdfunding in GB can be successful if we focus in Pop Genre.
